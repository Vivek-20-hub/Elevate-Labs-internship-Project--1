## Introduction
Employee attrition is one of the most significant challenges faced by organizations today. High turnover not only disrupts operational continuity but also results in substantial costs related to hiring, onboarding, and training new staff. Moreover, the loss of experienced employees impacts team productivity and organizational knowledge. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging data analytics and machine learning to understand the underlying causes of attrition and predict which employees are most at risk of leaving. By doing so, HR teams and management can take timely actions to improve retention, enhance employee satisfaction, and make data-informed strategic decisions.

## Abstract
The goal of this project is to predict employee attrition using historical HR data and provide actionable insights through data visualization and machine learning. We analyze multiple factors such as work environment, job role, salary, tenure, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics to uncover patterns that influence attrition. By building a logistic regression model and interpreting its output using SHAP, we gain a clear understanding of which features drive employee turnover. Furthermore, a Power BI dashboard is developed to visually communicate key trends and department-wise breakdowns. The outcome of this project serves not just as a predictive tool, but also as a strategic guide for implementing effective employee retention policies.
