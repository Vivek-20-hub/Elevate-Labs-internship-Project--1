## Introduction
Employee attrition is one of the most significant challenges faced by organizations today. High turnover not only disrupts operational continuity but also results in substantial costs related to hiring, onboarding, and training new staff. Moreover, the loss of experienced employees impacts team productivity and organizational knowledge. This project aims to address this issue by leveraging data analytics and machine learning to understand the underlying causes of attrition and predict which employees are most at risk of leaving. By doing so, HR teams and management can take timely actions to improve retention, enhance employee satisfaction, and make data-informed strategic decisions.

## Abstract

The goal of this project is to predict employee attrition using historical HR data and provide actionable insights through data visualization and machine learning. We analyze multiple factors such as work environment, job role, salary, tenure, satisfaction levels, and performance metrics to uncover patterns that influence attrition. By building a logistic regression model and interpreting its output using SHAP, we gain a clear understanding of which features drive employee turnover. Furthermore, a Power BI dashboard is developed to visually communicate key trends and department-wise breakdowns. The outcome of this project serves not just as a predictive tool, but also as a strategic guide for implementing effective employee retention policies.

## Python:
- Python was the primary programming language used throughout the project. It was chosen for its simplicity, rich ecosystem of data science libraries, and versatility in handling data analysis, machine learning, and automation tasks.

## Pandas:
- Pandas was used extensively for data loading, cleaning, manipulation, and transformation. It provided powerful data structures such as DataFrames, making it easy to filter, aggregate, and preprocess employee records from the CSV file.

## NumPy:
- NumPy complemented Pandas by offering high-performance numerical operations. It was particularly helpful during data standardization and when working with large arrays or matrix transformations.

## Matplotlib:
- Matplotlib was used to create static, customizable plots and charts. It played a crucial role in generating visual outputs such as bar charts, line graphs, and histograms that helped identify trends related to attrition.

## Seaborn:
- Built on top of Matplotlib, Seaborn allowed for easier and more aesthetic statistical visualizations. It was particularly effective in creating heatmaps, count plots, and distribution plots to uncover hidden relationships within the data.

## Scikit-learn:
- Scikit-learn was the core library for building and evaluating machine learning models. It was used to perform tasks such as splitting the dataset, training the logistic regression model, and calculating performance metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and the confusion matrix.

## SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations):
- SHAP was used to interpret the machine learning model by explaining the impact of each feature on predictions. It provided global and individual-level explanations, which helped identify critical factors leading to employee attrition.

## Power BI:
- Power BI was used to build an interactive and professional dashboard for visualizing attrition insights. It allowed end-users (such as HR teams) to filter by department, age, salary, and other variables to explore trends and support data-driven decision-making.

## Machine Learning Model

---
---

- Model Used: Logistic Regression, a binary classifier ideal for predicting "Yes" or "No" outcomes (i.e., whether an employee will leave).

- Input Features: Included age, monthly income, overtime status, job level, years at company, and job satisfaction.
 
- Key Insight: Employees with overtime, lower income, and low job satisfaction had 20–30% higher attrition probability on average.

- Evaluation Metrics: Used accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to ensure balanced performance.

- Confusion Matrix: Helped identify how often the model predicted attrition correctly vs. where it failed (e.g., false negatives).

## Model Interpretability (SHAP Analysis)

- Purpose: SHAP was used to understand why the model predicted attrition for certain employees.

---
## Top Influencing Features:
---

- OverTime — increased attrition risk by approx. 25–35%.

- Low Job Satisfaction — added to a 20% increase in attrition likelihood.

- Years with Current Manager — longer relationships correlated with lower attrition.

- Work-Life Balance — poor balance led to higher attrition risks.

- SHAP Summary Plot: Visually showed feature importance and the direction of influence (positive or negative) on attrition.

## Data Storage and Formats
---
The dataset used in this project, named HR_Analytics.csv, was sourced from Kaggle. It is a structured CSV (Comma-Separated Values) file containing records for multiple employees and features like age, education, job level, salary, and attrition status. After downloading, the data was loaded into Python using Pandas, which enabled efficient manipulation and analysis. Throughout the project, CSV remained the preferred format due to its simplicity, portability, and compatibility with both Python and visualization tools like Power BI.

## Visualization and Reporting
---
To communicate the findings effectively, we utilized Matplotlib and Seaborn for initial EDA visualizations and Power BI for final interactive reporting. Bar charts, heatmaps, and count plots were used to highlight patterns such as attrition by department, age group, and job role. The Power BI dashboard offers an intuitive interface for stakeholders to explore trends in attrition rate by filters like salary range, work experience, overtime status, and more. These visualizations support storytelling with data and enable decision-makers to pinpoint exactly where attention is needed.

## Steps Involved in Building the Project
---

1. Data Collection: The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle, a well-known platform for open datasets. It included detailed information about employees and their attrition status.

2. Data Preprocessing: The raw dataset was cleaned by handling missing values and removing irrelevant columns. Categorical variables were encoded using Label Encoding and One-Hot Encoding, and all numeric features were standardized using StandardScaler.

3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations were created to uncover meaningful trends and correlations, such as the impact of salary, department, and overtime on attrition. This step helped frame the modeling strategy.

4. Building the Prediction Model: A logistic regression model was trained on the cleaned and preprocessed data. Its accuracy and effectiveness were measured using a confusion matrix and classification report.

5. SHAP Value Analysis: To improve interpretability, SHAP was applied to understand the contribution of each feature to the model’s predictions. This provided transparency and helped identify key drivers of attrition.

6. Power BI Dashboard: A comprehensive dashboard was built to present visual insights, allowing HR teams to interact with filters and observe attrition trends in real time.

7. Employee Attrition Prevention Suggestions: Based on the model outputs and SHAP insights, actionable suggestions were generated, such as improving compensation, reducing overtime, and increasing managerial engagement for high-risk groups.
